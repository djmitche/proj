Goals
-----
 - set up a project environment with a simple command like `proj moz`
   - shell environment
   - EC2 instance started if necessary
 - manage resources
   - shut down EC2 instances when all projects on that instance are done

Plan
----
 - run this on a VPS somewhere
 - start/stop EC2 instances for major projects
   - buildbot
     - test dir on SSD
   - mozilla
     - objdirs on SSD
     - docker storage on SSD
   - other
 - Also want to start docker instances as necessary

Notes
-----

Multiple projects may share the same EC2 instance - (moz, sysadmins, fwunit) for example

Ideas
-----

Use Amazon EFS (NFS) to store a common home directory across all EC2 instances.
But also allow using SSD local storage where possible.
This is basically all just cloud-init config.

Ansible to manage host setup and reconfiguration on startup, pulled from some central repo.

EC2 instances should automatically shut themselves down at the end of their billing cycle if there are no inbound SSH connections.

Use elastic IPs to set up fixed hostnames both for SSH'ing and for webdev.

Can this get mixed in with `dev` somehow?  So ~/.devrc defining a bunch of projects with host and path (host can be localhost, or some spec - should be extensible).  `dev proj FOO` starts project FOO.

Nested project definitions:
  moz/tc/tools
  buildbot
  bits/exchanger
Each has a script to "enter"; that enters the next level with that context

`moz`:
  enter_ec2_instance i-abcdefg
`moz/tc`:
  enter_docker_instance taskcluster-devel
