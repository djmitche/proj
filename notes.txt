Goals
-----
 - set up a project environment with a simple command like `proj moz`
   - shell environment
   - EC2 instance started if necessary
 - manage resources
   - shut down EC2 instances when all projects on that instance are done

Plan
----
 - run this on a VPS somewhere
 - start/stop EC2 instances for major projects
   - buildbot
     - test dir on SSD
   - mozilla
     - objdirs on SSD
     - docker storage on SSD
   - other

Notes
-----

Multiple projects may share the same EC2 instance - (moz, sysadmins, fwunit) for example

Ideas
-----

Use Amazon EFS (NFS) to store a common home directory across all EC2 instances.
But also allow using SSD local storage where possible.
This is basically all just cloud-init config.

Use tags to identify EC2 instances; somehow link those to running SSH processes or something, and sweep them up as necessary.

Can this get mixed in with `dev` somehow?  So ~/.devrc defining a bunch of projects with host and path (host can be localhost, or some spec - should be extensible).  `dev proj FOO` starts project FOO.
